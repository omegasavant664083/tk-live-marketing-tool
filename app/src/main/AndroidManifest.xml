### Explanation of Key Components:
- **Permissions**: Each of the required permissions is declared with a problem-solving comment. For example, the `INTERNET` permission is crucial for enabling network communication, which directly addresses the need for continuous automated operations in managing social media tasks.
  
- **Activity Registration**: `MainActivity` is set as the launch point, allowing users to easily start the application.

- **Service Registration**: The `AutomationService` is registered to handle background tasks crucial for the app's functionality. This component is essential for maintaining the automation features that MadHub offers, allowing for seamless interaction with various social media platforms without user intervention.

The configuration follows best practices for Android app development while addressing specific problems that the app intends to solve.
